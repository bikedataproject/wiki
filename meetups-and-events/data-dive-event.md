# Data Dive event 13/11

On Friday November 13, we'd like to invite you as a cyclist, data analyst, mobility planner, city planner, activist or journalist to join us during our data dive event, where we want to explore the opportunities of a more bicycle-friendly city with open data.

**What will we do?**  
During this Data Dive event, we will both exchange ideas on how we can build a more bicycle-friendly city with open data and explore the data collected by cyclists in Brussels. After the event, we will also make the cycling data available as open data.

**Where is the event taking place?**  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be two options to take part in the event: either you attend remotely \(online\) or you join us at BeCentral \(if governmental measures allow\). When we finish the data dive, the apero is on us! ;\)

**Do I need a technical profile to come?**  
Absolutely not! Just your ambition to make cities better for cyclists.
