# Meetup 10/11

On Tuesdays 13 October, 27 October and 10 November, we'd like to invite you as a cyclist, data analyst, mobility planner, city planner, activist or journalist to join us during our Bike Data Project, where we want to discuss the opportunities of a more bicycle-friendly city with open data.

During this Data Dive event, we will both exchange ideas on how we can build a more bicycle-friendly city with open data and discuss how we can have more impact with the Bike Data Project in Brussels.

Where is the event taking place? Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this meetup will take place online.
