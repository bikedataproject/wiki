# Info about heatmap data

Link to the heatmap: [https://data.bikedataproject.org/map/](https://data.bikedataproject.org/map/)

The dataset available on [https://data.bikedataproject.org/heatmap/](https://data.bikedataproject.org/heatmap/) contains the following data:

* Vector tiles covering the whole world \([info about tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles)\)
* Each tile contains a number of dots
* Each dot contains the amount of cyclists that passed by

The data is published under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Some more useful information:

* The heatmap contains data collected from 2015 until now. It's on our roadmap to also add timestamps to the heatmap & open data.
* The actual heatmap is real-time updated. The data behind the heatmap will be updated on a daily basis.
* As we want to protect the privacy of individual cyclists, tracks only appear on the heatmap if at least 3 different cyclists have cycled on a specific road segment.
